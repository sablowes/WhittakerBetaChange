The WhittakerBetaChange repository includes R code to reproduce the analyses shown in the article: 

**Synthesis reveals approximately balanced biotic differentiation and homogenization**

*by Shane A. Blowes, Brian McGill, Viviana Brambilla, Cher F. Y. Chow, Thore Engel, Ada Fontrodona-Eslava, InÃªs S. Martins, Daniel McGlinn, Faye Moyes, Alban Sagouis, Hideyasu Shimadzu, Roel van Klink, Wu-Bing Xu, Nicholas J. Gotelli, Anne Magurran, Maria Dornelas, Jonathan M. Chase*

Alban Sagouis created new compilations of open access data used in these analyses. Code for the compilation can be found at:

## Analysis

**00-fit-models-maintext-code-for-eve**: This folder contains scripts that were used to fit statistical models to data shown in main text (written for EVE (HPC))

**00-fit-time-series-models**: This folder contains scripts that were used to fit statistical models to time series data

**dist2line**: Function to calculate distance to 1:1 line

**Fig2-1-wrangle.R**: Code to wrangle model results for Figure 2

**Fig2-2-plot.R**: Code to plot Figure 2

**Fig3-1-wrangle.R**: Code to wrangle model results for Figure 3

**Fig3-2-plot.R**: Code to plot Figure 3

**FigS2.R**: Code to plot Figure S2

**FigS3.R**: Code to plot Figure S3

**FigS4-and-S6.R**: Code to plot Figure S4, S6

**FigS5.R**: Code to plot Figure S5

**FigS6-1-wrangle-anti-ts-data.R**: data wrangle for Figure S6 (datasets with only two points)

**FigS6-1-wrangle-ts-data.R**: data wrangle for Figure S6 (time series data)

**FigS7.R**: Code to plot Figure S7

**xx-identify-studies-not-in-time-series-analysis.R**: Code to identify regions in the time series analyses. Due to poor naming choices, some regions changed names between the initial (two-time-point-only analysis) and the time series analyses. This code identifies the regions in the time series analysis, and was needed to identify the regions needed for the supplementary analysis (leading to Figure S4, S6).

## Data wrangle

Each subfolder has the code used to standardise sampling effort for different sources of biodiversity data at two scales: a smaller (alpha) scale, and larger (gamma) scale. Two sets of data (each documenting the alpha and gamma scales) are compiled: (1) effect sizes of the rate of change in species richness, calculated as the log-ratio of richness at the two time points, divided by the number of years elapsed between richness observations; and, (2) time series of richness and a diversity metric related to Simpson's concentration. 

## Data folder

This folder has the final output of the wrangled data required to fit the models. Additional regions (datasets) that needed to be removed from the time series analyses are in regions2remove.Rdata file.
